IOT project
1.	Device include Co2 sensor detect Co2 in the air and give alarm. Device also read Paticle matter sensor. 
a.	Using M5stack screen to display Co2 level, time, pm 2.5 level 
b.	Using M5stack kit with vibration motor. When Co2 increase to 1000ppm it will give notification and vibrate for 10 seconds. Repeat after 15 second if Co2 still more than 1000ppm
c.	Using M5stact to turn on the fan automatically when PM2.5 increase more than 100 ppm. 
2.	Device connect to wifi or bluetooth to simple phone app. (M5stack already has wifi and bluetooth hardware)

3.	Phone app can see Co2 and PM2.5 number, we can use app to turn on fan. 
4.	Fan power 12V â€“ 1Amp. 
5.	The hard ware will be power by battery 12V 3000mah. This battery can power the fan temporary if not plug into 12V source

look like mainly number 3 require work from app to bluetooth to turn on the fan.

The battery do have 5V out and 12V out. So all the hardware can be power by the 5V

the m5stack has 3 bottons, can you program that 3 buttons. 1 is to turn on and off. 2 is switch between reading of pm2.5 or Co2. Button 3 maybe for something else will develop later, maybe fan speed or some other sensor or information.
